**PhonePe Pulse Data Exploration Project with Streamlit, PyMySQL, and Pandas**

This project provides a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for exploring PhonePe Pulse data using Python libraries: Streamlit, PyMySQL, and Pandas.


**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Streamlit (pip install streamlit)
- PyMySQL (pip install pymysql)
- Pandas (pip install pandas)
- MySQL database server (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/installing.html)


**Clone this repository:**
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/phonepe-pulse-exploration.git
- Replace your-username with your GitHub username.


**Create a MySQL database and user:**
- Follow your MySQL server's instructions for creating a database and user with appropriate access privileges.
- Update config.py with your database credentials (hostname, username, password, database name).
- Installing visualization libraries like Plotly (pip install plotly) or Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib) for more advanced visualizations.


**Using the Dashboard:**
- The dashboard provides various interactive filters and charts to explore PhonePe Pulse data.
- Specific functionalities will depend on the data structure and your desired insights. However, common features might include:
- Date range selection: Allow users to filter data by specific date ranges.
- Category selection: Enable filtering based on categories within the data (e.g., location, demographics).
- Interactive charts: Generate charts like bar graphs, line plots, or geographical visualizations (if location data is available) to highlight trends and patterns.
- Descriptive statistics: Display summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for selected data subsets.
